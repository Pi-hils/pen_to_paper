Grief is a natural response to losing someone or something that you hold dearly to your heart. It may be a loved one passing, a relationship coming to an end, or you lost your job. Other life changes, like chronic illness or a move to a new environment, can also lead to grief. You may feel a variety of emotions, like sadness or loneliness. You may experience it for a number of different reasons.\

Everyone grieves differently. But if you understand your emotions, take care of yourself, and seek support, you can heal.


Whatever your loss, whatever your experience, wherever you live - there is someone here who understands. So log in, create a profile, and search for those with whom you will find you have much more than just your grief in common.
