Grief is a natural response to losing someone or something thatâ€™s important to you. You may feel a variety of emotions, like sadness or loneliness. And you might experience it for a number of different reasons. Maybe a loved one died, a relationship ended, or you lost your job. Other life changes, like chronic illness or a move to a new home, can also lead to grief.

Everyone grieves differently. But if you understand your emotions, take care of yourself, and seek support, you can heal.


Whatever your loss, whatever your experience, wherever you live - there is someone here who understands. So log in, create a profile, and search for those with whom you will find you have much more than just your grief in common.
